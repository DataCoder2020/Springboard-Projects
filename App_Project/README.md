# The Apps Project Learning Objectives:

Solve a real business problem with data, computational thinking, and statistics Practice using data science tools to analyze and visualize data Learn how to present the insights you've drawn from your analyzed data In this unit, you’ll get a chance to practice your data science and statistical skills by working with real-world datasets sourced from the definitive social medium for data scientists: Kaggle. Kaggle is a wonderful platform for data scientists to share datasets, challenges, and solutions. You'll use these datasets to work through each step of the data science pipeline to complete the Apps Project.

By the end of this unit, you’ll have experienced:

Approaching a dataset with a business problem in mind Using common data science tools Applying statistical and computational thinking Loading and transforming data for analysis Exploring data through the use of plots Presenting findings in a way that’s relevant for the business problem you’re trying to solve In short, you’ll have gained experience with the foundational skills that any professional data scientist needs.

We've built three versions of the Apps Project. Tier 1 is the easiest while Tier 3 is the most challenging version of this project. For each part of this project, you will be able to choose the tier that you'd like to work on. Regardless of the tier you choose, all tiers will give you the chance to write some data science code and practice working through the data science pipeline.

As a reminder, you'll be working in Jupyter notebooks to complete the project. You will have the opportunity to check your work at the end of this project. Your work will not be graded, though your mentor will have the solution set and can help you with any areas that you find challenging.
