## Error Bars

Matplotlib line plots and bar charts can include error bars. Error bars are useful to problem solvers because error bars show the confidence or precision in a set of measurements or calculated values. Bar charts without error bars give the illusion that a measured or calculated value is known to high precision or high confidence.

## Error bars in bar plots
To construct a bar plot with error bars, first import Matplotlib. If using a Jupyter notebook, include the line %matplotlib inline
